## 🧭 Know where you are in ServiceNow—instantly.

**Where Am I** adds subtle visual indicators to your ServiceNow instances, helping you distinguish environments at a glance.

Whether you're switching between `dev`, `test`, `staging`, or `production`, this extension overlays a clean, colored **diagonal banner** and updates the **favicon** based on the environment name in the URL.
